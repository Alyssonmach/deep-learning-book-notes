# Deep Learning Book Notes and Python Code Implementation

This repository contains my notes and Python code implementation while reading the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my understanding of deep learning concepts and to practice implementing them in Python.
